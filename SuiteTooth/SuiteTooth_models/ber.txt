# Input file for ber_calc_log.i0.em.x
# File format:  comment lines are allowed and
# must begin with a '#' character.  Comment lines
# are limited to 120 characters/line.

# Data format:  each non-commented line consists of a 
# value pair.  The first value is a ber value, followed
# by at least one space, followed by the corresponding eb/no
# value. ber_calc.i0.em.x limits the number of value
# pairs to 100.  This can be changed by adjusting 
# #define MAX_KNOWN_PAIRS to the desired count and rebuilding
# from the command line using op_mkema -type ps -m ber_calc_log.

# Other notes:  the modulation curve begins at an ebno value of
# min(ebno) - EBNO_MIN_BUFFER,  and ends at max(ebno) + EBNO_MAX_BUFFER.
# The distance between ebno points is the separation between begin and end points
# divided by the number of desired points (user input).
# This behavior can be altered by changing EBNO_MIN_BUFFER and/or
# EBNO_MAX_BUFFER and rebuilding.

# This file must be in the same directory as the executable to be located
# by OPNET. Run the executable and enter the name of this file, followed
# by the name of the new modulation curve. Enter the number of points 
# desired between min and max. The new modulation curve will be created 
# in the directory at the top of the mod_dirs list.
