ETS Models:

The ETS models in this folder are required for the SuiteTooth 
Scenario Creation Utility.  They have been developed to work with 
OPNET version 9.1.A. Changes to OPNET (including other versions) 
may affect the functionality of the ets scripts. 


Model Installation:

Instructions for installation of the SuiteTooth models may be 
found in the SUITETOOTH INSTALLATION section of the 'SuiteTooth
Documentation 2003.doc' Word document. 

The ETS model folder must be included in your model directory list 
(mod_dirs), and the path to the folder must be set in the Windows 
environment variables of your machine. See the documentation for
more details.
